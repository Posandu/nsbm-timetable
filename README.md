# NSBM Timetable to Google Calendar

This is a little script that converts the NSBM timetable (an excel file) to a Google Calendar format (ICS file) so that you can import it to your Google Calendar.

The .ics file is stored in a Github Gist, so it can be accessed from anywhere but you need to have the link to the Gist to access it.
